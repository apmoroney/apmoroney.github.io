			<h1>Life Manager Mobile Application</h1>
			<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>The concept of this mobile app is to provide a digital personal assistant that is more proactive in helping you manage your day-to-day tasks when compared to your device’s native assistant such as Apple’s Siri. By syncing your calendar entries from multiple platforms including the native option and other third-party productivity apps, it assists with basic information such as traffic alerts to manage travel time. Along with this, it also produces reminders based on your habits, and questions relating to activities you have completed to assist with similar activities in future. Through questions and answers, it becomes more intuitive. </p>
			<h3>Motivation</h3>
				<p>I believe there is a market for an app like this as the focus is on assisting in managing your personal life, rather than professional life. It will be designed to try and alleviate stress throughout your day and help make decisions based on prior data received. Speaking of motivation, it is also intended to try and encourage activity for those who may be lacking in motivation themselves. Through prompts such as “Have you remembered to take the bins out?”, it will remind the forgetful, encourage the lazy and assist the busy.</p>
			<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>There are three main reasons to use this app dependant on what the user wants it for. These three areas are Time Management, Reminders and Motivation. </p>
				<p>It also is broken down into four further categories. Lifestyle, Family, Social and Work. It would act somewhat modularly so that it is customised to each user. This is to prevent it working against the user, bombarding them with reminders and questions throughout the day that the user does not want.
				<p>Further to just basic calendar management and time management, the app will proactively ask questions based on your routine in order to prompt or remind you to perform daily tasks. This app does this through data you input when you initially install and set it up. </p>
				<p>As the app is designed to be proactive, it differs to traditional ‘Reminder’ style apps which rely solely on user input. For the social aspect of the app, it can perform tasks such as scouring SMS messages sent, looking for statements such as “I will speak to you next Wednesday”, and remind you to do so when it reaches Wednesday. This sort of interaction assists with the social aspect the app is designed to cover. </p>
				<p>For lifestyle items, you can integrate native fitness apps (like Apple Activity) to help achieve your fitness goals. For example, if you tell the app that you like to walk your dog daily, it will prompt you towards the end of the day if it has not been able to detect that you have already.  
				For family, it can handle simple reminders such as birthdays, but can also prompt reminders to make school lunches, and remind you about feedback you previously entered. These could be things you sent your kids to school with that they did not enjoy, or really did. </p>
				<p>Work related tasks are typically managed through your own work calendar, so the app is not designed to override that, or be actively involved in managing the day-to-day. You can connect the app to your work emails if you have them on your device, so that it can scour your emails, similarly to how it scours your SMS messages, to remind you to do things based on statements made. An example of this is if an email was sent stating “I’ll email you the details of what was discussed in the meeting by this afternoon”, it will detect whether or not any further emails were sent to this recipient by the end of the day. If not, it can either prompt you to late that afternoon, or set a reminder for the following day. </p>
			<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
				<p>Through research it appears that there are many coding languages which are used in app development. These include JavaScript, Java, Python, PHP and Ruby amongst others.</p>
				<p>The language that I would be interested in researching further into would be Python as I have heard about it very frequently lately. It also seems to be useful for analytic work which is what I do in my full-time job currently. As "Python is a highly used and all-purpose programming language which is dynamic in nature" (Luenendonk, M. (2015). Top Programming Languages Used in Web Development. [online] Cleverism), I feel this would be the most useful to learn at this point.</p>
				<p>It also seems that Python was developed to be user-friendly. According to Leunendonk, Python was developed using the below principles:</p>
				<ul id="">
					<li>Readability is important</li>
					<li>Complex is better than complicated</li>
					<li>Beautiful is better than ugly</li>
					<li>Simple is better than complex</li>
					<li>Explicit is better than implicit</li>
				</ul>
				<p>I also believe it would be advantageous to look at learning JavaScript which looks to be widley used for app development. Ruby and C++ may also be worth looking into. Ruby appears to be useful for creative designing while C++ is general purpose.</p>
			<h3>Skills Required</h3>
				<p>In conjunction with the obvious programming skills, "one of the most important elements is buildng (the) quality-rich user interface" (Redbytes: Custom Mobile Application Development Company [iOS, Android, Windows]. (2018). 9 Vital Skills To Become a Mobile App Developer | Redbytes. [online]). If the end-user isn't looking at something well presented, there would not be any uptake. Not only does it need to look good but also needs to function intuitively to prevent it being used incorrectly or being too complicated to use. The idea behind this concept is to make things easier for people so that goal could only be achieved through good user interface development.</p>
			<h3>Outcome</h3>
				<p>If successful, this app could benefit those who need help managing their personal, social, of work lives or lifestyles. It would be designed to be un-intrusive so it is not constantly bombarding the user with insights or reminders, if it were to, it could potentially cause more harm than good. It is not going to appeal to everybody, so the idea behind it being modular to allow users to choose the sections they want to use, would allow a larger market access to it, potentially making it commercially viable on a subscription basis.</p>
